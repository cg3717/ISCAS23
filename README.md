# ISCAS23
This repository contains the code and dataset used for the paper _Experimental Characterisation of Drift on ISFET
Arrays and its pH Dependence_ submitted to ISCAS 2023.
- run `all_exp_drift_LIN.py` for the core results use din the  paper
- `all_exp_drift_LIN_validation_min.py` and `all_exp_drift_LIN_validation_ph.py` are used for processing the validation datasets, respectively where the injection time and pH variation were modified
- the datasets are found in the folders `drift_exp`, `drift_exp_validation_min`, `drift_exp_validation_exp`
- figures of the results for each experiment are also present.
